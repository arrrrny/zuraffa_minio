## ZURAFFA MISFIRE RULE (HARD, NON-NEGOTIABLE — HARDCODED TOP RULE)

**On ANY misfire (test failure, compilation error, runtime crash, unexpected output) related to zuraffa:**

1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** on the first misfire.
2. **Report the issue** to zuraffa GitHub (`arrrrny/zuraffa`) with: the command that failed, expected vs actual output, and root cause.
3. **Continue with a workaround** to make the task pass (e.g., skip the failing test, use an alternative approach, or mock the failing component).
4. **Add a comment** in the code explaining the workaround applied and linking to the zuraffa GitHub issue.

**On ANY misfire related to the repo itself (not zuraffa):**

1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** on the first misfire.
2. **Report the issue** to the repo's GitHub with full details.
3. **Continue with a workaround** to make the task pass.
4. **Add a comment** in the code explaining the workaround applied.

This rule takes precedence over all other rules. Never skip a misfire or rationalize it away.

<!-- pool-pr:begin -->
## The forklift pool owns the PR — never merge a pull request yourself

Every pull request in these repos is reviewed by the **forklift pool**
(`arrrrny/forklift` — the local PR-review pipeline). It mints three tasks, in
this order, and that chain is the only sanctioned way from "PR opened" to "PR
merged":

1. `PR review <repo>#<n>` — the automated review; it posts its actionable
   findings on the PR.
2. `Apply review fixes <repo>#<n>` — one fixes round, pushed onto the PR's
   branch.
3. `Merge PR <repo>#<n>` — the merge itself; the task refuses while reviewer
   findings are still unaddressed.

**Never merge or close a PR by hand, and never merge one because it "looks
finished".** A hand merge lands the code while findings are still open: the
pool's fixes task is then killed by its closed-PR guard — the dispatcher log
says `…#<n> is closed — cancelled, no agent started` — and every finding the
review posted is dropped with nobody to own it. That is not a review, it is a
race the pipeline cannot win.

**Wait for the pool, and read the pool for the state.** The three task rows are
the truth; the PR page is not:

```bash
# the pool's board — loopback, IPv4-only (never `localhost`)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8888/tasks \
  | jq -r '.[] | select(.title | test("PR review|Apply review fixes|Merge PR")) \
          | [.title, .status, .id] | @tsv'
```

One row per stage. `status` is one of `queued`, `running`, `done`, `failed`,
`needsInput`, `cancelled`, `paused`. The PR is done when the
`Merge PR <repo>#<n>` row reads `done`. A fixes row that reads `failed` or
`cancelled` means the PR was **not** reviewed-and-fixed: read the row's
`errorMessage`, fix the cause, and let the pipeline requeue it (relabelling a
failed task requeues it in the same call — `POST /tasks/<id>/label`).

**An agent can simply wait for the whole process** — poll the board above until
the `Merge PR` row is terminal. Everything else is the pool's job: it drives
the review, the fixes round and the merge.

<!-- tmp-clone:begin -->
## Work in a `/tmp` clone — never in `~/Developer`

Every piece of work on a PR or an issue happens in its own clone under `/tmp`,
and that clone dies with the task:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git /tmp/<repo>-<pr-or-issue>
```

Never clone into `~/Developer`, and never clone into the forklift checkout —
a bare repo slug as the clone target is how a stray checkout ends up inside the
repo root, and a clone left behind in `~/Developer` is indistinguishable from
the primary checkout. The pool's lanes already mint their clones this way
(`/tmp/fix-pr-<n>`, `/tmp/review-pr-<n>`, `/tmp/issue-<n>`, …) and remove them
when the task settles.
<!-- tmp-clone:end -->

<!-- local-ci:begin -->
## Running CI locally — `scripts/local_ci.sh`

GitHub Actions is billing-blocked on our private repos: every workflow run ends in
~3s with **zero steps executed**, so a red check here means nothing. Run the same
gate locally instead:

```bash
./scripts/local_ci.sh              # every job of the pull_request workflow
./scripts/local_ci.sh --plan       # print every step that would run, run nothing
./scripts/local_ci.sh --list       # workflows, triggers and jobs in this repo
./scripts/local_ci.sh --job <id>   # one job only
./scripts/local_ci.sh --event push # simulate the push-triggered workflow
./scripts/local_ci.sh --keep-going # do not stop at the first failure
./scripts/local_ci.sh -v           # echo each command before running it
```

It reads `.github/workflows/*` at run time and executes that workflow's jobs and
steps in order, so it cannot drift from CI — it is not a second copy of the gate.
Edit the workflow and the local run changes with it. Exit 0 means every executed
step passed.

What it cannot reproduce, and prints on startup instead of guessing:

- **Linux.** CI runs `ubuntu-latest`; this runs on macOS. The step set is the
  same, the platform is not. `sudo apt-get install` steps are mapped to a local
  presence probe rather than silently passed.
- **GitHub context.** A step needing `${{ secrets.* }}`, `${{ inputs.* }}`,
  `${{ vars.* }}`, `${{ steps.* }}` or `${{ github.event.* }}` is SKIPPED with the
  reason printed, never run with a guessed value.
- **`uses:` actions** are not executed. Toolchain setups (`setup-dart`,
  `setup-node`, `flutter-action`, `rust-toolchain`, …) become a version assertion
  against the local tool; checkout/cache/artifact are noted as no-ops; anything
  else is skipped by name. A Windows-runner job is skipped outright.
- **Cargo cross targets.** A step that builds for a rust cross target (e.g.
  `cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2`) is answered against this host's
  toolchain: a rustup toolchain carrying EVERY target the step asks for is used
  for that step — selected through the rustup proxy (`RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN`), so
  `cargo +<toolchain>` keeps working — and when no local toolchain carries them
  the step is SKIPPED with the reason printed (`rustup target add <target>`) —
  never a red step that says nothing about the repo. The toolchain the workflow
  pins wins over another one that merely happens to carry the target. A host
  with no rust toolchain at all is a MISSING TOOLCHAIN, not a missing target:
  the step FAILS, as this script's convention says.
- **`container:`** jobs run on the host toolchain, not in the declared image.
- **`continue-on-error: true`** steps are advisory locally, exactly as in CI.
- **Local-only checkout state.** CI checks out the committed tree; this checkout
  also has gitignored and untracked paths, which whole-tree commands (e.g.
  `dart analyze .`) see. A step that fails naming only such paths is reported as
  a LOCAL-ONLY failure, not as a CI failure — pass `--strict` to count it anyway.
  A step that would `git clone` over a sibling checkout that already exists here
  is skipped; `--allow-outside-clone` forces it.

Canonical copy: `arrrrny/forklift` → `scripts/local_ci.sh` (reference:
`docs/forklift-scripts.md`).

<!-- test-concurrency:begin -->
## Test concurrency (fleet guard)

Cap test concurrency at **2** — one un-capped `flutter test` fan starved the
shared host's services once (load 260; arrrrny/forklift#176).

There is **no config-file knob for `flutter test`**: it ignores
`dart_test.yaml` entirely (its only test-config file is
`flutter_test_config.dart`, an execution hook), so the flag is the only
lever — and it must be passed every time:

```sh
flutter test --concurrency=2
dart test -j 2
```

A repo whose `dart_test.yaml` carries `concurrency: 2` already defaults to it
for `dart test`; pass the flag anyway when you override it, and never raise
the number on a host that also runs the forklift pool. CI carries the same
flags in `.github/workflows`.
